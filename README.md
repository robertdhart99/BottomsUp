# BottomsUp
drink catalog app that anyone can rate and view suggestions 

The App as of sprint one is just a main activity where you can see the drinks in a recyclerview and card format. you should be able to click on the drinks and get a toast msg saying you clicked the specific drink. 

we used firebase for a real time database.
at the moment all tests pass but circle ci fails

Data comes from firebase thanks to retrofit/service. data is then connected to the ui with an adapter class.
